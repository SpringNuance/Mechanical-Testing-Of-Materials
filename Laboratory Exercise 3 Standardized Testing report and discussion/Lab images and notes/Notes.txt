Extensometer to measure strain , which has a strain gauge inside

Instrument measuring device

what we are doing today is using glueable strain gage to measure tensile strain

We are going to detach the strain on the specimen

We can measure y axis strain and x axis strain 

We receive 2 files

Only one tensile test 
1) 1st specimen we do only 1 test
we choose aluminium 

use the manual to report all values like e and NU

Strain gages Kyowa manufacturer 

two outputs: force and extensometer, are coupled/synchronized

30kN on the machine corresponds to 10 wolt signal, which is about 15 percent of strain

strain gauge signal is micrometer per meter

Biaxial strain gauge measure in X and Y (reference from Kyowa) KFGS-5-120-C1-11 L1M2R

the adhesive glue is CC 33 A 

HPM amplifier

thickness is 1.95 mm
width is 12.12 mm
length between the ending of the two radiuses (named parallel length) 50.50 mm

the applied glued of the strain gauge on the specimen must be very thin.

after the middle part has been cleaned, we would pour 1 drop of glue cc 33 e onto the back of the strain gauge on the metal sheet. Then we use a thin paper to press the strain gauge against the tensile experiment for around 2 minutes. then we remove the paper

manual: SFS EN ISO 6892 1:2019, page 32 about strain rate. We choose strain rate 2

convert strain rate 0.00025 1/m

so we multiply this strain rate with parallel length 0.00025 x 50mm = 0.012625 mm/s * 60 = 0.75 mm/minute

first stage: 0.75mm per minute
second stage 1.5mm per minute 

during the tensile test we can actually change the strain rate as well.

it was slower strain rate during the elastic part. Then we should increase the strain rate for faster experiment, maybe twice the speed

report different ways of measuring strain and makes sure it is useful

the extensometer measures strain along y, and the red strain gauge measures strain along x direction

var1 is the percentage where we would increase the speed. we do not zero out the load as the specimen is already subject to the stress due to gripping)

SG signal is negative suggesting that it is thinning. 

68 GPa aluminum grade 5000
67 GPa measured

standard called SFS-EN ISO 6892-1:2019

You can access the SFS standards through library pages. Just look for online version SFS standards and from there you can look for the one we used in laboratory session.
